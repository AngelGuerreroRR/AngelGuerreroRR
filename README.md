## 🧠 About Me

**English:**  
I am a Biomedical Systems Engineer and Mathematician, currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at UNAM, specializing in *Signals, Images & Virtual Environments (SIAV)*.  
My work integrates artificial intelligence, medical imaging, and surgical navigation — developing systems that fuse multimodal data (CT, MRI, DICOM) with real-time tracking and 3D visualization in Unity.  

I am passionate about building intelligent systems for medical applications, combining Python, C#, and Unity to create robust and visually interactive solutions for research, education, and surgical support.
